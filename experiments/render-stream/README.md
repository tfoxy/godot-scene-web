# render-stream experiment — gate −1: capture seam

Gate −1 of [docs/handoff-headless-render-stream.md](../../docs/handoff-headless-render-stream.md).
It answers one question before any protocol work starts:

> Can a GDExtension observe every `RenderingServer` drawing and texture call made
> by an **unmodified official** Godot release template running `--headless`,
> without patching code, without a custom engine build, and without any way to
> damage a shipped game?

**Answer: yes, measured.** A GDExtension copies the `RenderingServer` singleton's
vtable into the heap, replaces up to 31 slots with pass-through recording hooks
(the eight gate −1 hooks, plus 23 draw-path hooks added for gate −0.25), and
publishes the copy with one aligned pointer store into the singleton object's
first word. Native `Control` drawing, the `Label` glyph path and direct
`RenderingServer` calls from GDScript are all intercepted; the engine's own call
sites are **not** devirtualised away by the official build's LTO. Disarming
restores the original vptr and the process exits 0.

The end target is a modder loading this into a shipped game (STS2, a stripped
MegaDot 4.5.1 fork) through `GDExtensionManager.load_extension`, so the library
refuses by default: it does nothing at all unless it is handed a calibration
record that matches the running binary byte for byte, and `GRC_MODE` must say
`arm` before the one store happens.

## The pinned binary

```
~/.cache/godot-render-stream/templates/4.5.1-stable/linux_release.x86_64
sha256 54cc228405e5be61934192e3bc5461c91dcb4a3275578b29a869557a4322e79c
```

Official `Godot_v4.5.1-stable_export_templates.tpz`, member
`templates/linux_release.x86_64`, range-extracted from the archive (the member
alone, not the whole template set). It is a non-PIE (`ET_EXEC`), stripped,
dynamically linked x86-64 ELF with no GNU build-id, and it reports
`Godot Engine v4.5.1.stable.official`. It is not committed here; neither is any
other engine binary.

Matching source for the header the calibrator parses: `../godot-4.5.1-stable`,
commit `f62fdbde15035c5576dad93e586201f4d41ef0cb` (read-only reference).

## How it works

`RenderingServer` is an abstract `Object` subclass; `RenderingServerDefault` is
the only concrete implementation and adds no virtual slots. `Object*` and
`RenderingServer*` are the same address (single inheritance, vptr at offset 0),
so the singleton's first word is its vtable address point, and slot `i` is
`*(vptr + 8*i)` — Itanium ABI, declaration order.

1. **Calibrate** (`capture/tools/calibrate.py`, offline, read-only): find the RTTI
   typeinfo name strings `15RenderingServer` and `22RenderingServerDefault`, the
   typeinfo objects that point at them, and the primary vtables that point at
   those (offset-to-top 0, typeinfo pointer, then slots). Walk each vtable and
   record per slot whether it holds a code address or the pure-virtual
   placeholder. Parse the ordered virtual list of `class RenderingServer` out of
   the pinned `servers/rendering_server.h` with the release define set
   (no `TOOLS_ENABLED`, no `DEBUG_ENABLED`, `DISABLE_DEPRECATED` **not**
   defined), derive the `Object` prefix as `slot_count − new_virtuals`, then
   require the whole implemented/pure mask to agree and the matching prefix to be
   unique.
2. **Verify at runtime** (`capture/src/calib.cpp`): see "Safety model" below.
3. **Arm** (`capture/src/vtable.cpp`): `calloc` a table of `slot_count + 2`
   pointers, copy the live table from two words before the address point (so
   offset-to-top and the typeinfo pointer come along), overwrite the hooked slots
   the record names, then one `__atomic_store_n(..., __ATOMIC_RELEASE)` of the new address
   point into the object's first word.
4. **Hook** (`capture/src/hooks.cpp`): each hook records and calls the original
   function pointer with the identical arguments. The hooks are plain functions
   whose first parameter is the `this` pointer, which is exactly the ABI of the
   member functions they replace.
5. **Disarm**: if the object still carries our address point, store the original
   back. The shadow table is deliberately leaked — another thread can be
   mid-dispatch through it at that instant.

### Measured calibration

| Binary                                  | Version                      | Slots | Object prefix | `RenderingServer` virtuals | Anchors   |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----- | ------------- | -------------------------- | --------- |
| `4.5.1-stable` `linux_release` (pinned) | `4.5.1.stable.official`      | 588   | **23**        | 565                        | 17/17     |
| `4.5.1.stable.mono` `linux_debug`       | `4.5.1.stable.mono.official` | 607   | **42**        | 565                        | 17/17     |
| `4.6.2.stable` `linux_release`          | `4.6.2.stable.official`      | 592   | **22**        | 570                        | 17/17     |
| `4.7.2.stable` `linux_release`          | `4.7.2.stable.official`      | 603   | not derived   | —                          | mask only |

The prefix is 23 on the 4.5.1 release template and 42 on the debug one because
`DEBUG_ENABLED` turns `MTVIRTUAL` into `virtual` and adds `Object` virtuals; 4.6
dropped one `Object` virtual, hence 22. 4.6 also renamed
`RenderingServer::free` to `free_rid`, which the calibrator accepts under the
record key `free`. No 4.7 source is checked out locally, so the 4.7.2 row is a
measurement only (`--mask-only`): its implemented-slot mask has the same shape as
4.6.2's (slots 0–19 and 22 implemented, 20/21 the zeroed destructor pair), which
is consistent with prefix 22, but the calibrator refuses to assert a prefix it
cannot verify against the matching header.

Two facts worth knowing about this build family: pure-virtual slots in the
abstract vtable are **literally null** (there is no `__cxa_pure_virtual` symbol
in the binary at all, and no relocation covers those words), and the two virtual
destructor slots of the `Object` prefix are also zeroed in the abstract vtable.
The runtime check therefore requires all hooked slots to share one placeholder
value, that value not to be code, and the 17 anchors to be code — rather than
assuming any particular sentinel.

### Hooked slots on the pinned binary

"Tier" is the calibrator version that first emitted the slot. Tier 1 is gate −1's
set and is required; tier 2 is optional (see "Calibration records and hook
versions" below). "Captured" is what the hook records beside its count. Every
signature is copied from the 4.5.1 header, with the line cited in
`capture/src/hooks.cpp`.

Floats are written as values and as float32 bit patterns (`*_bits`). Arrays keep
their first 64 elements, and `*_total` gives the real length. A tier-2 hook
deduplicates identical calls into one entry with `calls`, `first_frame` and
`last_frame`. It keeps at most 32 distinct entries and counts any further
distinct calls in `captured_dropped`. Nothing that owns memory is decoded: no
`String`, `StringName` or `Variant`. `SurfaceData` is read in place through the
engine's pointer, and only its leading members up to `aabb` are read. Their
offsets are pinned by `static_assert`s in `capture/src/abi.h` and by the
`abi_decode` unit test. The offsets were also cross-checked with `offsetof` probes
compiled against the pinned 4.5.1 header itself: primitive 0, format 8, the
vertex/attribute/skin buffers 16/32/48, vertex_count 64, index_data 72,
index_count 88, aabb 92, struct size 240.

The calibrator also refuses to write a record whose named slots would not pass
the library's own runtime check: pure-virtual in the abstract vtable and
implemented in the concrete one.

### Calibration records and hook versions

A record produced by an older calibrator still loads in the current library.
That record may come from a sibling calibrating another binary with whatever
`calibrate.py` was on `main` at the time. The rules:

- **Tier 1 slots are required.** If a record does not name one of the eight
  gate −1 hooks, the library refuses with `slot-mask-mismatch` before any write.
  It now refuses in `validate` mode too, so validate predicts what arm would do.
- **Tier 2 and later slots are optional.** If a record does not name one, that
  hook is not installed. Nothing is guessed, and the record is not refused. The
  omission is recorded in three places:
  - `calibration-check.json` gets an ok `hook_plan` entry whose detail names the
    omitted hooks, for example:
    `8 of 31 hooks named by the record; omitted (record predates them): …`.
  - `counters.json` lists the hook under `hooks_omitted`, and its `counts` value
    is `null` rather than `0`. A `null` means "not installed", which is
    different from "never called".
  - stdout gets a `[grc] hooks: …` line.
- **Every slot a record names is verified, whether or not it is hooked.** It must
  be pure-virtual in the abstract vtable and implemented in the concrete one, or
  the library refuses with `slot-mask-mismatch`.
- **Changing the calibrator.** Adding a key to `WANTED_SLOTS` is backward
  compatible. Bump `CALIBRATOR_VERSION` and add the hook as optional. Renaming or
  removing a key is not backward compatible. The gate's `old-record` leg proves
  that a version-1 record (tier 1 slots only) still arms.

## Build, calibrate, run

```bash
# build + unit test (cmake is at /snap/bin/cmake; override with CMAKE=)
experiments/render-stream/scripts/build-capture.sh

# re-derive the committed record, plus uncommitted records for the other local
# templates under artifacts/render-stream/calibration/
experiments/render-stream/scripts/calibrate.sh
experiments/render-stream/scripts/calibrate.sh --check   # diff, do not overwrite

# an engine fork that rebrands GODOT_VERSION_NAME (the version string is "<name> v<build>")
python3 experiments/render-stream/capture/tools/calibrate.py --binary <elf> \
  --header ../godot-4.5.1-stable/servers/rendering_server.h --version-name MegaDot --out <record>
```

The build writes `capture/build/librender_stream_capture.so` and
`capture/build/render_stream_capture.gdextension` (absolute library path,
`entry_symbol = "grc_library_init"`, `compatibility_minimum = "4.5"`). Both are
ignored. Load the `.gdextension` from a fixture autoload, as `fixtures/spike/loader.gd` does:

```gdscript
GDExtensionManager.load_extension(OS.get_environment("GRC_EXTENSION"))
```

### Run gate −1

```bash
experiments/render-stream/scripts/build-capture.sh
experiments/render-stream/scripts/calibrate.sh --check
mise exec -- pnpm render-stream:gate-minus1 -- \
  --extension "$PWD/experiments/render-stream/capture/build/render_stream_capture.gdextension" \
  --calibration "$PWD/experiments/render-stream/calibration/godot-4.5.1-stable-linux-release.json"
```

About 80 seconds. It imports the fixture once with the mise editor (the release template cannot
run a loose project without `.godot/`), runs the six headless legs and the two rendered legs in a
private `gamescope --backend headless`, then the checker, which writes
`artifacts/render-stream/gate-minus1/<UTC timestamp>/result.json` and exits non-zero unless every
check passed. Legs, evidence layout and criteria: [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md). Checker
self-test: `mise exec -- pnpm exec tsx --conditions=development
experiments/render-stream/scripts/test/self-test-checker.ts`.

## Runtime contract

Environment, read once at SCENE initialisation:

| Variable                  | Meaning                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GRC_CALIBRATION`         | absolute path to the record. Absent or unreadable → refuse `no-calibration`; present but malformed → refuse `invalid-calibration` |
| `GRC_MODE`                | `validate` (default; all checks, all evidence, never writes the vptr) or `arm`                                                    |
| `GRC_EVIDENCE_DIR`        | absolute directory, created if missing. Unset → the same payloads go to stdout as `[grc] evidence <name> …` lines                 |
| `GRC_DISARM_AFTER_FRAMES` | integer; disarm after that many armed frame callbacks. Unset → stay armed until the shutdown callback                             |

Arming happens at the earliest point where the `RenderingServer` singleton is
available. With a runtime `load_extension` from an autoload that is SCENE
initialisation, because the engine singletons are already registered by then —
this is the path the scratch runs exercise, and the one the fixture uses. A
startup-loaded extension reaches SCENE initialisation at `main/main.cpp:3633`,
before `register_server_singletons()` at `main/main.cpp:3704`, so
`global_get_singleton("RenderingServer")` would still be null; the attempt is
then retried from the `startup` callback and from each `frame` callback until the
singleton exists. Only the first successful attempt decides.

That deferred path was first run on 2026-10-09, with the extension listed in a
scratch project's `.godot/extension_list.cfg` on the pinned template. It refused
a correct record as `slot-mask-mismatch`: the retry re-parsed the record into the
same lists and the anchors doubled to 34/17. Loading the record and collecting the
fingerprint now start from empty. With that change the startup-loaded extension
defers at `scene-init` and decides at `startup`: `validated` in validate mode;
`armed` in arm mode, where the scripted `add_rect` is bit-exact, and then
disarmed and restored. A `load_extension` from a `--script` `SceneTree._initialize`
arms at `scene-init` directly.

A mod's managed code always runs after the singletons exist, because
`ScriptServer::init_languages()` follows `register_server_singletons()`
(`main/main.cpp:3707`). So a `GDExtensionManager.LoadExtension` call from mod code
decides at `scene-init` and never needs the deferred path. Gate −0.5 measured the
same on the target game.

Evidence files, exactly as the runner expects:

- `result.json` — `render-stream-capture-result/1`: `status`
  (`armed|validated|refused|error`), `reason`, `vptr_written`, `disarmed`,
  `display_server`, `rendering_driver`, `rendering_method`. Written at decision
  time and rewritten at shutdown.
- `fingerprint.json` — version string, sha256, build-id, pie, load bias, live
  vptr, singleton address, abstract address point, pure placeholder, pid, and the
  `/proc/self/maps` lines of the main binary.
- `calibration-check.json` — every check with `ok` and a detail string.
- `counters.json` — `render-stream-gate-minus1-counters/1`, written at disarm and
  at shutdown. Floats are printed with `%.9g` **and** as IEEE-754 float32 hex
  bits.
- `disarm.json` — `disarmed`, `vptr_was_shadow`, `vptr_restored`, `frame`.
- `armed.marker` — empty file, created immediately after the vptr store.

Deviations from the drafted contract, all additive:

- `counters.json` adds `image_details_available` (whether the `Image` method
  binds resolved), and each `canvas_item_add_polygon` entry adds `points_total`,
  `colors_total` and `texture`; captured point/colour lists are truncated at 64
  elements per call, which `points_total`/`colors_total` make visible.
- `texture_2d_create`/`texture_2d_update` entries carry `rid`, `details`, `frame`
  and (for updates) `layer` beside the drafted `width`/`height`/`format`/`data_size`.
  `frame` is the 1-based main-loop iteration the call arrived in, the same numbering
  as the fixture's own frame counter (the frame callback runs after process and
  draw), so an expected atlas update can be placed in time.
- `invalid-calibration` is a reason code in addition to the drafted ones, for a
  record that exists but does not parse or carries the wrong schema.
- Calibrator 2 added keys only; the schema string is unchanged. The new
  `counters.json` keys are:
  - `hooks_planned` and `hooks_omitted`, as described in "Calibration records and
    hook versions".
  - one `counts` entry per tier-2 hook, `null` when the hook was omitted.
  - one `captured` array per tier-2 hook, in the shapes listed in the slot table
    above.
  - `captured_dropped`.

  `calibration-check.json` adds the `hook_plan` check.

## Safety model

- **Refusing by default.** No `GRC_CALIBRATION`, no action. Default `GRC_MODE` is
  `validate`, which never writes.
- **Identity before anything else.** sha256 of `/proc/self/exe`, the GNU build-id
  (required absent when the record says `null`), the `get_godot_version2` version
  string, PIE flag and load bias must all match the record; a PIE binary's bias
  is taken from `dl_iterate_phdr` and added to the recorded addresses.
- **No call into an unidentified slot, ever.** The live checks only _read_ vtable
  words. The one behavioural call is `get_default_clear_color`, which the record
  names, compared byte for byte against the same method reached through
  `classdb_get_method_bind` + `object_method_bind_ptrcall`. This is what proves
  the derived indices are real and not just self-consistent.
- **One write.** A single aligned pointer-sized store with release ordering into
  heap memory the engine allocated for the singleton. Nothing else in the process
  is modified: the library imports neither `mprotect` nor `mmap` (checked with
  `nm -D --undefined-only`), and an `strace` of an armed run shows no `mprotect`
  from the arming thread after the `armed.marker` `openat`.
- **Verified restore.** Disarm compares the live vptr with our shadow address
  point before restoring, and re-reads it afterwards; both facts land in
  `disarm.json`.
- **Failure is refusal, not a crash.** A missing `Image` method bind downgrades
  texture captures to counts only; a failed check refuses with a reason; the
  hooks hold no locks across the forwarded call except the small capture mutex,
  and counters are atomics because calls arrive from loader threads too.

What this does **not** establish:

- that the shipped game's stripped fork has the same vtable layout. It needs its
  own record, which is exactly what the calibrator is for.
- that the capture is complete. 31 of the 565 `RenderingServer` virtuals are
  hooked.
- anything about performance.

## Gate −1 result (2026-10-08)

**Pass.** The integrated run is
`artifacts/render-stream/gate-minus1/20261009T020323Z/` (ignored, not committed; produced
in the integration worktree). Its `result.json` passes 18 of 18 checks across the eight
criteria in [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md). The fixture is `fixtures/spike/` on
the pinned template.

### The gate fails when it should

Three sabotaged runs, none committed, each failing exactly one check, all under
`artifacts/render-stream/gate-minus1/`:

| Sabotage                                         | Run                       | Failing check                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `SCRIPT_RECT.x` 213.25 → 213.5 in `spike.gd`     | `sabotage-a-script-rect/` | #4 `script-add-rect`                           |
| `ShadowVtable::disarm` skips the restoring store | `sabotage-b-no-restore/`  | #6 `disarm-restored` (`vptr_restored: false`)  |
| `hook_add_rect` forwards green + 1/255           | `sabotage-c-hook-colour/` | #7 `armed-vs-unarmed-pixels` (channel delta 1) |

In (c), pixelmatch reported 0 differing pixels. The explicit `maxChannelDelta: 0` caught
the change.

### What this proves

- A GDExtension loaded at runtime into the unmodified official 4.5.1 release template
  can interpose on `RenderingServer` under `--headless` with one pointer store. It
  makes no code-page change and opens no GPU device. It sees native Control drawing,
  the Label glyph path including the atlas update the relabel causes, and direct
  script calls, all with exact argument bytes.
- It disarms cleanly. Rendered output is byte-identical with capture armed and with
  capture absent.
- It refuses before writing on a wrong digest, a wrong slot table, a missing record
  and a one-byte binary change.

### What this does not prove

- The `add_msdf_texture_rect_region` and `add_texture_rect` hooks were never called:
  the default font is a bitmap atlas, and the fixture has no `TextureRect`. They are
  installed, but their argument decoding has not been exercised.
- Only 8 slots were hooked in that run, so nothing in it says the capture is
  complete. The 23 draw-path hooks added afterwards are covered in the next
  section.
- Only Linux x86-64 and this one binary were tested. The startup-loaded path (deferred
  arming) was not run here; it was run, and fixed, on 2026-10-09 (see "Runtime contract").
- MegaDot and the shipped game were not tested. Their stripped fork needs its own
  record, which is gate −0.5.
- No costs were measured.

## Gate −0.5 result (2026-10-09)

**Pass.** The operator approved the run. The library ran unmodified with
`GRC_MODE=validate` against the installed STS2 binary (`MegaDot v4.5.1.m.14.mono.custom_build`,
non-PIE, with a GNU build-id). The instance was owned, isolated and `--headless`, run under
sts2-couch-coop's instance rules.

- **Offline calibration.** `calibrate.py --version-name MegaDot` against the pinned 4.5.1 header gives
  588 slots: Object prefix **23** plus 565 `RenderingServer` virtuals. **17/17** anchors match, the
  mask is unique, so there are no interior insertions, and the pure placeholder is 0. The hooked-slot
  indices are identical to the stock release template's. The record holds addresses and a digest of a
  commercial binary, so it is kept in that repository's ignored research folder, not here.
- **Load route.** The modder route. An env-gated, dev-only couch-coop hook calls
  `GDExtensionManager.LoadExtension(<absolute .gdextension>)` at mod init and logs `LoadStatus` `Ok`.
  It runs on a couch-coop branch and is not merged. The mod was deployed into a private game-root
  copy, not into the install. The extension decided at `scene-init`.
- **Decision.** `validated`, `vptr_written: false`. All 13 runtime checks pass: digest, version
  string, build-id, bias, live concrete vptr equal to the recorded address + 16, anchors 17/17 in
  memory, hooked slots pure in the abstract table and implemented in the concrete one, and the
  `get_default_clear_color` probe byte-equal through the slot and through the method bind. The game
  reached its normal main-menu readiness and stayed up through the settle window.
- **Negative.** The every-index-+1 record is refused `slot-mask-mismatch` with anchors 11/17, before
  the behavioural probe.
- **Safety.** The operator's profile, the Steam remote store and the install's binaries hash identical
  before and after.
- **Teardown.** After the main menu, the game ends on SIGTERM by SIGABRT ("terminate called without an
  active exception"), with or without the extension. The control leg reproduced it, so "no crash" is
  judged over the running window.

## Draw-path hooks for gate −0.25 (2026-10-09)

Gate −0.25 arms counters on the real game. It needs counters for the paths the
game draws through: Spine rigs drawn by the spine-godot GDExtension, nine-patch
styleboxes, meshes and primitives. Calibrator 2 adds 23 optional hooks for those
paths (the tier-2 rows of the slot table above). The fixture now drives every one
of them.

**Pass.** Run `artifacts/render-stream/gate-minus1/20261009T031006Z/` (ignored,
not committed) passes 28 of 28 checks: the 18 gate −1 checks plus 10 new ones,
listed in [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) as #7 `new-drawings-visible`,
#9 and #10.

### spine-godot's draw path

spine-godot draws through `canvas_item_add_mesh`, not
`canvas_item_add_triangle_array`. The source is
`spine-godot/spine_godot/SpineSprite.cpp` on the `4.2` branch of
EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes. That file was fetched and read, and it matches
the pinned copy at commit `e7dc1435`
(`sts2-couch-coop/.sts2/research/data/spine-reliable-sep04/upstream/`, sha256
`8eb74951…`). Each `SpineMesh2D` runs `_notification(NOTIFICATION_DRAW)`, which
calls `clear_triangles` (`canvas_item_clear`) and then `add_triangles`. In 4.x
`add_triangles` calls `update_mesh`. The `#ifdef SPINE_GODOT_EXTENSION` branch is
the one a GDExtension build such as the game's `libspine_godot` compiles:

- **When the mesh is rebuilt** (vertex or index count changed): `free_rid` (the
  `free` slot), `mesh_create`, then `mesh_add_surface_from_arrays` with the
  `ARRAY_FLAG_USE_DYNAMIC_UPDATE` flag. That method is implemented in
  `RenderingServer` itself and calls the virtual `mesh_add_surface`
  (`servers/rendering_server.cpp:1390-1396`). It then calls `mesh_get_surface`
  and the stride getters, which only read.
- **Every other frame**: `mesh_surface_update_vertex_region(mesh, 0, 0, …)`,
  `mesh_surface_update_attribute_region(mesh, 0, 0, …)` and
  `mesh_set_custom_aabb`.
- **Always**: `canvas_item_add_mesh` of that mesh, with an identity transform, a
  white modulate and the renderer object's canvas texture.

`canvas_item_add_triangle_array` appears only in the Godot 3
`VisualServer` branch. A GDExtension reaches these methods through ClassDB
method binds, and those binds call the virtual member functions
(`rendering_server.cpp:2350-2375`, `3315`, `3327`, `3471`). Every call in the
list above therefore dispatches through the shadow vtable, and each one has a
hook. The fixture's ArrayMesh reproduces this shape: one surface with dynamic
update, per-frame vertex and attribute region writes, a custom AABB each frame,
then `canvas_item_add_mesh`.

The rendered-armed leg is armed for all 400 frames on OpenGL under X11. It counts
400 or 401 calls of every per-frame hook, so the same paths are hooked on the GPU
renderer too. `unarmed.png` and `armed.png` are still byte-identical (sha256
`985ed809…`), and the new drawings appear in both. Each one covers a sample pixel,
and one sample lies inside the mesh only because the per-frame vertex update
moved that vertex.

A calibrator-1 record (leg `old-record`) arms with 8 hooks and omits 23. Each
omitted hook has a `null` count and is named in `hook_plan`. The armed run counts
`add_rect` 62 and `add_polygon` 61, and disarm restores the vptr.

### What is left

- `canvas_item_add_texture_rect` and `canvas_item_add_msdf_texture_rect_region`
  are still never called by this fixture, as at gate −1. Every tier-2 hook is
  exercised.
- Count-only by design: `shader_create_from_code`, `shader_set_code` and
  `material_set_param` record RIDs and leave their `String`, `StringName` and
  `Variant` arguments undecoded. Those are reference-counted, owning types, so
  decoding them means reproducing more engine ABI than a counter needs. Gate 5.5
  needs captured shader source, and that should go through a ClassDB call rather
  than a layout copy. The three gate −1 hooks `texture_rect`,
  `texture_rect_region` and `msdf_texture_rect_region` also stay count-only.
- Not hooked but on spine-godot's path: `mesh_get_surface` and the format and
  stride getters. They are read-only queries and draw nothing.
- Signatures that needed care: `canvas_item_add_mesh` takes its mesh RID **by
  reference**. `canvas_item_add_nine_patch` passes its axis modes as 4-byte enums
  and puts `draw_center` and `modulate` on the stack. The fixture captures
  `draw_center = false` and the modulate exactly, which proves the tail of that
  argument list. `mesh_add_surface` takes `SurfaceData` by reference.

## Gate −0.25 result (2026-10-09)

**Pass.** The operator approved this gate too. It used the same owned, isolated `--headless` STS2
instance and the same modder load route as gate −0.5, with the 31-hook library. The record was
re-derived with the version-2 calibrator: 31 of 31 hooks are named, and the indices are identical to
the stock template's. The run was `GRC_MODE=arm` with `GRC_DISARM_AFTER_FRAMES=2000`.

- **Readiness.** Normal main-menu readiness at 27 s. The library armed at `scene-init`, stayed armed for
  about 4 minutes (2000 frames at the game's idle frame cap) and disarmed itself with
  `vptr_was_shadow` and `vptr_restored`. The game stayed up afterwards. RSS was flat and there was no
  crash.
- **Counts.**

  | Hook                                       | Count  |
  | ------------------------------------------ | ------ |
  | `canvas_item_add_rect`                     | 3      |
  | `canvas_item_add_texture_rect`             | 6      |
  | `canvas_item_add_texture_rect_region`      | 25     |
  | `canvas_item_add_msdf_texture_rect_region` | 247    |
  | `canvas_item_add_mesh`                     | 65 604 |
  | `mesh_surface_update_vertex_region`        | 65 571 |
  | `mesh_surface_update_attribute_region`     | 65 571 |
  | `mesh_set_custom_aabb`                     | 65 571 |
  | `mesh_create`                              | 83     |
  | `texture_2d_create`                        | 1 526  |
  | `canvas_item_add_triangle_array`           | 0      |
  | `canvas_item_add_nine_patch`               | 0      |
  | `canvas_item_add_polygon`                  | 0      |

  The three equal mesh counts are spine-godot's per-frame pattern. They show the rigs animating
  through a third-party extension on the dummy renderer. This is the first live exercise of the
  `texture_rect` and `msdf_texture_rect_region` hooks.

- **Teardown.** Writing evidence by frame count matters here, because this game ends on SIGTERM by
  SIGABRT before any GDExtension shutdown callback runs.

## Scratch verification (2026-10-08)

A throwaway project under the ignored `artifacts/render-stream/scratch/` —
autoload loading the extension, a `ColorRect`, a `Label`, and a `_draw()` making
one `canvas_item_add_rect` and one `canvas_item_add_polygon` call with bit-exact
values — run as
`linux_release.x86_64 --headless --path <proj>` for eight frames:

```
GRC_MODE=arm      armed,    vptr_written=true,  disarmed=true, exit 0
  frames_total 8, frames_armed 8, intercepted 33
  canvas_item_add_rect 3, canvas_item_add_texture_rect_region 12,
  canvas_item_add_polygon 2, texture_2d_create 2, texture_2d_update 7, free 7
  display_server "headless", rendering_driver "opengl3",
  rendering_method "gl_compatibility"
GRC_MODE=validate validated, vptr_written=false, all counters 0
GRC_MODE unset    validated (default), vptr_written=false
GRC_CALIBRATION="" refused no-calibration,        vptr_written=false
nonexistent path   refused no-calibration,        vptr_written=false
record, sha256 zeroed            refused fingerprint-mismatch, vptr_written=false
record, every index +1           refused slot-mask-mismatch,   vptr_written=false
GRC_DISARM_AFTER_FRAMES=2        disarmed at frame 2, frames_armed 2, restored
```

Captured values, bit-exact and by value:

- From the scripted `_draw()`: `rect [213.25, 27.5, 101.125, 49.75]`
  (`0x43554000 0x41dc0000 0x42ca4000 0x42470000`), `color [0.125, 0.5, 0.75, 1]`;
  polygon points `[[10.5, 20.25], [140.75, 20.25], [75.125, 96.5]]` with three
  colours and `uvs_count 0`.
- From the native `ColorRect` (no script involved): `rect [0, 0, 160, 80]`,
  `color [0.25, 0.5, 0.125, 1]` — the scene's `Color(0.25, 0.5, 0.125, 1)`.
- From the `Label`: twelve `canvas_item_add_texture_rect_region` calls (the glyph
  path) plus a 256×256 format-1 glyph atlas created once and updated seven times,
  with sizes read off the `Image` through `Image.get_width`/`get_height`/
  `get_format`/`get_data_size` method binds.

The `+1`-shifted record is caught by the anchor mask (11/17 anchors matched),
not by the hooked slots — a neighbouring slot is pure-virtual too, which is
exactly why the 17 implemented anchors are part of the check and why the
calibrator insists the matching prefix be unique.

### Negative finding worth keeping

Godot's `Vector<T>` is **two words, not one**: it leads with an empty
`VectorWriteProxy<T> write` member (`core/templates/vector.h`), so the CowData
element pointer sits at offset 8. Decoding it as one word read the wrong word out
of every `Vector` argument and segfaulted on the first `canvas_item_add_polygon`
with a default-constructed `uvs`. `capture/test/abi_decode.cpp` now pins both the
offset and `sizeof`. The shape of a wrong-ABI failure is worth remembering: the
hooks still forwarded correctly (the engine never noticed), only the _recording_
was wrong — a silent-corruption class that only bit-exact expected values catch.
